Title: showcase

I don't think the showcase panels should have any content from case's edits at all
I think they should be one consistent aethetic, and if possible, that aesthetic should be COOL, B&W, vhs-esque.
I want people wearing sunglasses, paranoia, guys in coats on wall st. A GUN???
I want one screen to go red after seeing something, or just blank.
skyscrapers, helicopters, two friends kissing, two friends fighting, 

technical questions:

How should these sequences be randomized? Obviously we want certain behaviors to accompany certain pieces of content, like after showing a gun flashing red.
How will these sequences plug into HTML? what format would be best? I'm thinking maybe gifs are best, but how do I keep track of duration? Can I track when a gif ends
or do I need to keep track of the duration of each clip?
